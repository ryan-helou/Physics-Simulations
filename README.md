# Physics Simulation Software

Welcome to the Physics Simulation Software repository! This software provides three interactive physics simulations: Particle Attraction, Double Pendulum, and Newton's Cradle. Each simulation offers a unique experience for users to explore and understand various concepts in physics.

## Simulations

### 1. Particle Attraction Simulation
This simulation allows users to observe the behavior of particles under the influence of gravitational attraction. Users can set the initial positions and velocities of the particles and observe how they interact over time.



### 2. Double Pendulum Simulation
Experience the chaotic motion of a double pendulum with this simulation. Users can adjust parameters such as the length of the pendulum arms and initial conditions to observe the complex dynamics of this system.

### 3. Newton's Cradle Simulation
Explore the conservation of momentum and energy with Newton's Cradle simulation. Users can interact with the cradle by releasing balls and observing the transfer of momentum through the swinging motion of the balls.
